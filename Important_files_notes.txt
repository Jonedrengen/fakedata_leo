What is this?: 
- This fake data generator generates fake covid data, based on a real covid dataset. 
- This means that the data always will try to look like the dataset it is based on
- If you wish to change the real dataset it is based on, you should replace all files in "important_files"

important_files:
  AmbiguousSites_details.csv
    variables -> AmbiguousSites,amount_seen
    description: contains all different possible values of AmbiguousSites from original covid data. Also contains the amount_seen (weight), 
    which determines how often that value shows up in the generated data
    
  BatchSource_SequencingType_combinations.csv
    variables -> BatchSource,SequencingType,weight
    description: contains all combinations of BatchSource and SequencingType

  Complete_reference_data.csv
    variables -> BatchSource,DateSampling,WhoVariant,LineagesOfInterest,lineage,UnaliasedPango,Nextclade_pango,clade,weight
    description: this file contains a wide range of combinations of essential variables as well as how often that combination shows up (weight)

  NCount_details_above30.csv
    variables -> NCount,amount_seen
    description: this dataset contains all ncount values that showed up more than 30 times in the original dataset, as well as how often they showed up (weight)

  NCount_Amb_Seq_Split.csv:
    variables -> SequenceExclude,QcScore,ManualExclude,Amb_low_NCount_low,Amb_low_NCount_high,Amb_high_NCount_low,Amb_high_NCount_high
    description: this file contains all possible variations of SequenceExclude, QcScore and ManualExclude. The following four variables contains
    how many of these combinations has AmbiguousSites values above 5 and NCount values above 3000
    example: 
      Amb_high_NCount_low = 100 -> means that said combination of SequenceExclude, QcScore and ManualExclude shows up 100 times, when the AmbiguousSites value is above 5
      and the NCount value is below 3000 
    This is used to determine when the combination of SequenceExclude, QcScore and ManualExclude should show up. 
    for example if the QcScore has "Fail: Too many Ns" it means that the NCount is above 3k or if SequenceExclude has "TooManyNs;MixedStrain;ManuallyExcluded"
    it means both the NCount is above 3000 (TooManyNS) and the AmbiguousSites is above 5 (MixedStrain)
    HowToRetrieve:
    SELECT 
      SequenceExclude, 
      QcScore, 
      ManualExclude, 
      SUM(CASE WHEN NCount < 3000 and AmbiguousSites < 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Amb_low_NCount_low,
      Sum(Case when NCount >= 3000 and AmbiguousSites < 5 Then 1 else 0 end) as Amb_low_NCount_high,
      Sum(Case when NCount < 3000 and AmbiguousSites >= 5 Then 1 else 0 end) as Amb_high_NCount_low,
      SUM(Case when AmbiguousSites >= 5 and NCount >= 3000 Then 1 else 0 end) AS Amb_high_NCount_high
    FROM GenEpiBioTrain.V_CovidPlots
    GROUP BY SequenceExclude, QcScore, ManualExclude;

  qc.mixedsites.totalmixedsites.csv
    variables -> qc.mixedSites.totalMixedSites,amount
    description: contains all possible distinct qc_mixedSites.totalMixedSites and how often then show up (amount_nextclade_pangos).

  qc_mixedsites_possibilities.csv
    variables -> qc.mixedSites.totalMixedSites,Min_score,Max_score,counted
    description: This contains the every possible qc_mixedsites_totalmixedsites as well as the min and max score of qc.overallScore 
    as well as how often the qc_mixedsites_totalmixedsites value shows up with a qc.overallScore between Min_score and Max_score (counted)
