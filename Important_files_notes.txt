What is this?: 
- This fake data generator generates fake data, based on a real dataset. 
- This means that the data always will try to look like the dataset it is based on
- If you wish to change the real dataset it is based on, you should replace all files in "important_files"

  ManualExclude_SequenceExclude_QcScore.csv:
    description: Contains the different possible variations and weights of ManuelExclude, SequenceExclude, and QcScore, based on the real data
    HowToRetrieve: In SQL Azure Data Studio, execute the SQLQuery on GenEpiBioTrain.V_Covidplots
    usage: Should be used to define ManuelExclude, SequenceExclude andQcScore in generated data
    TODO: make it do what usage describes

    Notes:
      NULL values are excluded here, because in code, whenever NCount is NULL, AmbiguousSites will also be NULL

  Complete_reference_data.csv:
    description: Contains the Dates of sequencing for the sample variants (lineage of interest). As well as how often variants are sequenced (weigts)
    HowToRetrieve: In SQL Azure Data Studio, execute the SQLQuery on GenEpiBioTrain.V_Covidplots
    SQLQuery: SELECT distinct DateSampling, LineagesOfInterest, COUNT(*) as weight 
    FROM GenEpiBioTrain.V_CovidPlots 
    GROUP BY DateSequencing, LineagesOfInterest
