Step 1:
Clone this repository into a code editor that supports Python (I recommend VSCode or PyCharm). You can use Git terminal commands or GitHub Desktop.

Step 2:
Create an isolated environment for your project:
- Use Python's built-in environment creation tools, or
- Download and use Conda

Step 3:
Install all required packages in your environment.

Step 4:
Run `Complete_dataset.py` to generate your files. By default, it is set to create 8500 batches with 96 samples per batch. If you wish to change the batch size, modify the script accordingly.
